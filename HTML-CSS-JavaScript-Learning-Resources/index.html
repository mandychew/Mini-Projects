        I've learnt the basics of JavaScript purely on YouTube, and compiled them into a playlist.  
        It's also effective to learn by doing hands-on projects, so I've included 3 project tutorials in the playlist.

    <h1>Tips for learning web development</h1>
    <p>If you're using a computer, I'd recommend the following suggestions. 
        If you aren't using a computer to learn web development, 
        then skip suggestions 2 and 3. You can use online code editors 
        or do online courses instead.

    <h2>2. Use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">VS Code</a></h2>
    <p>VS Code is a code editor so good that most of the software development world uses it. (If you watch recent YouTube videos on Programming in general, you'd realise that most of them use VS Code.)<br>
        It can read most types of files, including .html, .css and .js, perfect for web development!<br>
        Futhermore, you can install several useful extensions that will make programming easier. That leads to the next tip...
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2>3. Use some of the following VS Code Extensions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Auto Rename Tag</li>
        <li>Auto Close Tag</li>
        <li>Bracket Pair Colorizer</li>
        <li>Live Server</li>
        <li>Prettier</li>
        <li>JavaScript (ES6) Snippets</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After installing VS Code on your computer, 
        navigate to the Extensions tab on the Side bar to get these extensions.
